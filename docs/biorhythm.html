<H4>General Information About Biorhythm Theory:</H4>
<DIV class="margin">

<P>Biorhythm Theory tells us that every individual is influenced by three regular biological cycles that are initiated at birth. These cycles control our Physical, Emotional, and Intellectual states and can be described using sine waves. When one of the cycles is in a positive phase (the sine wave is above the zero point,) the abilities and energies it influences are high. When it goes into a negative phase, those abilities and energies are weakened. Each cycle has a different length of repetition, or period. Because of this, the cycles sometimes reach moments of convergence, when all three are either at their apogee or perigee. Most of the time, though, the cycles are out of phase. This results in mixed abilities and energies across the different categories. The most important time in a cycle is during Critical Days, or Switch-Over Days, days when a cycle passes through the zero point, either increasing or decreasing. During these times, abilities and energies for the cycle's category vary wildly and are unstable.</P>

<P>The three cycles and what they influence are as follows:</P>
	<UL>
	<LI><P><B>Physical Cycle</B><BR>
		<UL>
		<LI>23 days long
		<LI>Influences: strength, endurance, hand-eye coordination,
			disease resistance, etc.
		</UL></P>
	<LI><P><B>Emotional Cycle</B><BR>
		<UL>
		<LI>28 days long
		<LI>Influences: moods, sensitivity, creativity, passion,
			optimism, intuition, 6th sense, etc.
		</UL></P>
	<LI><P><B>Intellectual Cycle</B><BR>
		<UL>
		<LI>33 days long
		<LI>Influences: memory, alertness, speed of learning, reasoning
			ability, computational accuracy, etc.
		</UL></P>
	</UL>

<P>Biorhythm Theory has been investigated by Swiss scientists using medical records and advanced statistical analysis. It has been shown to be an uncannily accurate means to predict a person's psychosomatic state. For instance, the famous actor Clark Gable suffered a fatal heart attack on a Critical Day. Also, the Japanese have been using biorhythms for years to alleviate traffic and industrial accidents.</P>

<P>Because of this direct correspondence, you can use biorhythms to plan out your day, or even plan out your entire life! Simply consult your biorhythm chart to know when to engage in physically, emotionally, or mentally demanding activities. For example, on a day when your physical cycle is positive you might want to run in a marathon. Conversely, on a day when your physical cycle is negative, you should do routine tasks and get plenty of rest. Most importantly, on a day when you are going through a Switch-Over, a Critical Day, you should avoid surgery at all costs; the risk of death is much too high!</P>

<H4>MindGuard's Implementation of Biorhythms:</H4>
<DIV class="margin">
<P>MindGuard uses your biorhythm to generate an anti-psychotronic strategy tailored to your current biorhythmic state. Since different carriers and signals work to infiltrate your mind in different ways, some may be successful on days when you are emotionally weak or intellectually unstable. Having MindGuard know what your weaknesses are for any given day helps it to focus its efforts where you most need them.</P>

<P>MindGuard displays a four week biorhythm chart with today at the center. Each tick on the horizontal zero-line represents one day. The cycle colors are as follows:</P>
	<UL>
	<LI><B style="color:red">Red</B> = Physical
	<LI><B style="color:green">Green</B> = Emotional
	<LI><B style="color:blue">Blue</B> = Intellectual
	</UL>

<P>If you hold the mouse over the biorhythm chart, a legend will pop up to remind you what the colors represent.</P>

<P><B>NOTE:</B> MindGuard currently doesn't calculate biorhythms for the yet-to-be-born. It is recommended that the mother's birth date be used as a basis for the biorhythm. This will have some effect on fetal psychotronic exposure, but will not offer the full biorhythmic syncing that it does for the born. Please see <A href="fetus.html">MindGuard and fetuses</A> for more on these issues.</P>

<P>In addition to its use for syncing with your psychometric needs, MindGuard's biorhythm display can be used to view your chart for personal activity planing. A more in depth discussion of this use is beyond the scope of this guide. Those interested should visit their local library or visit
<A href="http:/zapatopi.net/psident.html">the MindGuard PsIdent page</A> on the Internet for web links.<P>
