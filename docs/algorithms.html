<P>The <B>Algorithm Drop Menu</B> in the scan settings section of the main window lets you pick which detection/deciphering algorithm is given preference. (MindGuard will attempt all algorithms if the selected one fails.)</P>

<P>MindGuard currently uses the following detection algorithms:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P><B>Dishevel-Bippsie</B><BR>
The most widely used psychotronic detection and deciphering algorithm. It has a 87% success rate.</P>

<LI><P><B>LZI & LZII</B><BR>
These were created by me to make up for weaknesses in D-B. They are most effective against paraterrestrial carriers. LZI uses a passive-phase reducer, and is best suited to <A href="antarctic.html">Antarctic relay</A> signals. LZII uses an active-phase inducer, and is best suited to <A href="reticulan.html">Grey</A> transmissions. The LZ class has an 92% success rate.</P>

<LI><P><B>PsyDET</B><BR>
Deciphering/detection algorithm created by Vikku Gurtu (see <I>"Multi-Phasic Imprints,"</I> INDOPSYCHO '93 Proceedings, Delhi: Valmiki Press, 1994, pp.44-67.)</P>

<LI><P><B>Xebec</B><BR>
The "official" psychotronic detection/deciphering algorithm approved by the UN, CIA, NSA, Disney, and other assorted baddies and Liberati sycophants. Needless to say, this algorithm is filled with holes that let all manner of psychotronic pollution into your head. It was designed to lull people into a false sense of protection from the Liberati while also blocking paraterrestrial carriers, thereby giving the terrestrial agencies an advantage in the Liberati/Reticulian mind race. <I><B>DO NOT SELECT THIS ALGORITHM!</B></I> It was included for the ironic enjoyment of advanced users only.</P>
