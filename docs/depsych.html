<P>MindGuard's DePsych is a psychotronic/subliminal message brain-deprogrammer.</P>

<H4>How DePsych Works:</H4>
<DIV class="margin">
<P>DePsych can remove psychotronically induced images, suggestions, etc. that have been building up in your mind through contact with various and sundry psychotronic vectors.</P>

<P>DePsych creates a neuro-sensory pathway between you and your computer via the optic nerve. Holographically encoded information is presented with a blue line-band that takes advantage of your occipital lobe's parallax processing abilities to decode. DePsych sends you specially tuned, neural-resonating engrams that can cancel out most common types of psychotronic/subliminal programing. It also sends "trigger-signals" that can flush and reset your short-term memory areas (what could be compared to the memory buffers for your sensory processing centers.)</P>

<P>DePsych can handle the following types of mind-pollution:</P>
	<UL>
	<LI>Post-hypnotic/psychotronic suggestions
	<LI>Subliminal-images:
		<UL>
		<LI>Empagrams
		<LI>Ideoglyphs
		<LI>Optillusions
		<LI>Product logos
		</UL>
	<LI>Synaesthetic associative memes
	<LI>Recursive harmonies:
		<UL>
		<LI>Circular logic
		<LI>Motor-reflex feedback
		<LI>Commercial jingles
		</UL>
	<LI>Political/cultural propaganda
	<LI>And more
	</UL>
</DIV>

<H4>Usage:</H4>
<OL>
<LI><P>Turn off any lights in the room (except, of course, the monitor)</P>

<LI><P>Position yourself so the distance from your eyes to the monitor corresponds with the following chart:</P>

<PRE>
Monitor Size   Eye Distance
(in. diag.)
---------------------------
8"             2"
13"            3"
15"            5"
17"            7"
21"            9"
</PRE>

<LI><P>Click the <B>DePsych</B> button in the main window.</P>

<LI><P>Stare into the blue band that updates in the DePsych window, focusing your eyes behind the monitor so that the two squares above the blue band converge into one.</P>

<P class="warning">WARNING: Do not follow the green line as it updates the blue band. Doing so will compromise the deprogramming and may cause epileptic seizures.</P>

<LI><P>Continue to stare until MindGuard tells you that all traces of psychotronic programing have been flushed. Be patient, it may take a while depending on the depth of psychotronic recursion.</P>

<LI><P>If you need to abort a deprograming session before its completion, press the left mouse button</P>

<P class="caution">CAUTION: Aborting a deprograming session before MindGuard says to may leave psychotronic residue unflushed leaving you vulnerable to mind control.</P>
