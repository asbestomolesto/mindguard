<P>UN carriers:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>UN metric types I & II - Used by the United Nations and many of its daughter organizations (UNICEF, etc.) to further their reeducation programs and to indoctrinate the peoples of the Earth into UN approved ways of thinking. Metric type I uses VLF radio-psychonomy while type II uses EHF. Both encipher using a phase distortion algorithm and act directly on the cortex.</P>

<LI><P>UN Belgian subset (all NATO variants) - The Belgian subset is a variant on UN metric type II and is used by the <A href="http://zapatopi.net/belgium/">Belgian Conspiracy</A> as well as it's military off-shoots. The Belgian Conspiracy is a sect of the UN that believes that all sovereign countries should be annexed by the UN, through force if necessary.</P>
