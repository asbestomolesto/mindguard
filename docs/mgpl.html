  All persons not affiliated with evil mind-control agencies are
  hereby granted permission to copy and distribute unaltered copies
  of this license in its entirety.

			Preramble

  The licenses for most software are designed by memetic engineers
to take away your freedom to think independently through
engramatically harmonized semantics, legalistic hypnosyntax, and
spirit-breaking CAPITALIZATION (in all senses of the word).  By
contrast, the MindGuard Public License is intended to guarantee your
freedom to think--by guaranteeing your freedom to use, alter, and
share free anti-mind-control software.  This Public License applies
not only to MindGuard, but also to any other program whose authors
commit to using it.  This includes you, assuming you are not an evil
mind-control agent.

  When I speak of free anti-mind-control software, I am referring to
freedom of thought, not price.  This Public License is designed not
only to make sure you have the freedom to think, but to also allow you
to freely express your thoughts through the distribution of copies of
free anti-mind-control software (with service charge if you wish) and
the availability of said software's source code, that you may change
it or use parts of it in new free anti-mind-control programs.  For
what is source code but thought logically expressed and haphazardly
indented?

  To protect your mind from those that would subvert
anti-mind-control software, restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you or ask you to give up your rights must be made.  These
restrictions mean responsibilities for you if you distribute or
modify copies of the software.

  These responsibilities include giving all the rights that you have
under this license to any recipients of copies of the software,
regardless of whether any fee was involved or not; making sure that
they can get the source code, if they so choose; and making sure that
they know their rights as outlined in this license.

  Your rights are protected by copyrighting the software and/or using
this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

  Also, to protect anti-mind-control software authors from waves of
bogus lawsuits by the psychotronically controlled puppets of the evil
mind-control agencies, it is important that everyone understands that
there is no warranty (NO WARRANTY) for this free anti-mind-control
software.  If the software is tampered with by evil mind-control
agents so that it, say, causes epileptic seizures in its users, those
users should know that they were the victims of the evil mind-control
agencies so that these crimes against Humanity do not reflect
negatively on the original author nor cause people to stop using free
anti-mind-control software.

  Finally, any free anti-mind-control program is threatened constantly
by those with political powers who are the very agents that this
software was created to protect you from.  To avoid the danger that
they will use their sway with patent offices to claim ownership of the
software and thus make it proprietary and untrustworthy, any patent
must be licensed for the free use of all non-evil mind-control agents
or not licensed at all.

  The mind-numbingly (but not mind-controllingly) precise terms and
conditions for copying, distributing and modifying follow.

			MINDGUARD PUBLIC LICENSE
	TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING AND MODIFYING

  0. The MindGuard Public License (hereinafter referred to as "This
License" or "this License" depending on its sentential positioning)
applies to any work (hereinafter referred to as the "Program") which
contains a notice placed by its copyright holder under his, her or
its freewill ("freewill" hereinbefore and hereinafter being defined
as not being under the influence of any form of mind-control) stating
that said work may be distributed under the terms of this License.
A "work based on the Program" hereinafter means either the Program
itself or a work containing a portion or the totality of the Program
either with or without modifications, translations, transliterations,
or transformations.  (Hereinafter, the term "modification" shall
include, without limitations, the last four terms of the previous
sentence excluding the term "or" unless "or" is used to refer to a
boolean function applied to modify the Program or any part of it.)
Each licensee is addressed as "you", as in the statement "You are a
licensee".  (The statement "You are not a licensee" will hereinafter
have no logical meaning.)

Copying, distribution and modification are the only activities covered
by this License.  If you are interested in other activities, please
read another License and stop wasting both of our time.  You may run
the Program free of restrictions.  The product of running the Program
or a work based on the Program (hereinafter referred to as the
"Output") is covered by this License only if it constitutes, in whole
or in part, a work based on the Program (excluding consideration that
it was made by running the Program) or the Program itself.  This only
applies if it happens to apply.

  1. unaltered copies of the Program's source code as you received it
may be copied, distributed, and/or posted, in any medium or mediums,
so long as each copy contains an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty with excessive capitalizations; that all
notices that refer to this License and to the lack of warranty are
kept intact and not modified; and that any and all recipients of the
Program or the Program's source code are given a copy of this License
included with the Program.

Fees may be levied for the act of distribution or transference of
copies of the Program.  However, no fees of any sort shall be levied
against a recipient of the Program for any Program related activities
after it is has been transfered to him or her or it.  A fee for
warranty protection may be offered, but a recipient must be under no
obligation to accept the warranty.  Fees for support services may
also be offered, but again no obligation to purchase those services
shall be placed on the recipient of the Program.  (Hereinafter such
practices as prohibited in the two previous sentences shall be
referred to as "Naughty".)

  2. You may modify any or all of your copies of the Program or any
portion of said copies, thus forming a work based on the Program.
You may copy, distribute, or post such modifications or work as per
the terms of Section 1 above, provided that the following conditions
are met:

    a) All modified copies of the work must carry prominent notices
    stating that you modified them and the date of any modifications.

    b) Any work based on the Program, in whole or in part, that you
    distribute, publish, or post must be licensed as a whole under
    the terms of this License at no charge whatsoever to anyone.

    c) If the Program in its modified form runs interactively, it
    must be caused by you to print or display in its normal usage an
    appropriate notice as to its copyright and lack of warranty (or
    if a warranty is offered as per Section 1 above, that it make
    notice of said warranty) and that it notify users that it may be
    redistributed under the terms of this License and that it inform
    users on how to attain or view a copy of this License.
    (Exception: if the Program on which your work is based does not
    do the above, your work based on the Program is not required to
    either.)

    d) You are not now, nor have you ever been, nor will you ever be
    an agent or sycophant of an organization or group, formal or
    informal, that aims, in whole or in part, to practice
    mind-control on any sentient or semi-sentient organism or entity
    for any purpose whatsoever; or to subvert any form of
    anti-mind-control in any way whatsoever, including works based
    on the Program.  Nor shall you be an independent agent working
    toward those goals stated herein this Subsection 2d.

All hereinbefore terms apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
parts of the work not based on the Program can be reasonably
considered to be separate works independent of the parts based on
the Program, then those parts are not covered under the Terms of
this License provided that you distribute them as separate works.
Data files or separate module files not covered by the terms of this
License that may be opened, read, or run by other works not covered
under this License may be distributed with works under this License
without this License applying to them.  If the above is not the case
and the parts not based on the Program are distributed as a whole
work with the Program or parts based on the Program, the
distribution as a whole must come under the terms of this License,
and those terms for and rights granted to licensees must extend to
the whole entire work and every little part of it regardless of
authorship, excepting such parts as you are not licensed or
permitted to include in the whole work, which would presumably be
there by an act of violation of copyright laws on your part.
Shame on you.

This section has no intention of claiming rights for or contesting
your rights to work created entirely by you.  The intent of this
section is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
modified, collected, or derived works based on the Program.

The simple inclusion of a work or part of a work covered by this
License, as delineated hereinbefore and hereinafter, on a storage
or distribution medium does not bring any other works on said
medium not covered by this License under the terms of this License.
If this paragraph wasn't here, the Internet as a whole would fall
under this License.  Aren't you glad I included it?

  3. You may copy, distribute or publish the Program or work based
on the Program in object code or executable form (both hereinafter
referred to as the "Binary") under the terms in Sections 1 and 2
hereinbefore, provided one of the following conditions is also met:

    a) The Binary is accompanied with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable, non-encrypted source code, distributed under
    the terms of Sections 1 and 2 hereinbefore on a medium normally
    used for the exchange of software by users of the intended
    computing platform or platforms of the Program; or,

    b) The Binary must come with a written offer, valid for at
    least pi years, to give any third party, for a fee no greater
    than the actual cost to you of source code distribution, a
    complete copy of the corresponding source code as described in
    Subsection 3a hereinbefore to be distributed under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 hereinbefore on a medium as described in
    Subsection 3a hereinbefore; or,

    c) The Binary must come with the offer to distribute the
    corresponding source code that you received when you received
    the Binary.  (This option only applies to noncommercial
    distributions and only if the binary you received came with
    such an offer as described in Subsection 3b hereinbefore.)

Hereinbefore and hereinafter, the "source code" for a work shall
mean the form of the work preferred for making modifications to it
by sane programmers or what passes for sane programmers in normal
situations.  For Binary distributions, complete source code means
all the source code for all the Binary files it contains, plus
any associated files, scripts or data needed for the compilation
and installation process of the Binary files.  Files included in
the distribution but not covered by this License, as described in
Section 2, shall be excepted from the previous condition.  Also
excepted shall be anything that is normally distributed (in either
source or binary form) with the major components of the operating
system or environment which the Binary runs on or with, unless
that component itself is distributed with the Binary.

If the Binary distribution is made by offering access to copy
from a location, either physical or cyberspatial, then offering
the exact same access to copy source code, even if third parties
are not compelled to do so, satisfies the conditions of this
Section.

  4. You may not copy, modify, distribute, post, or sublicense the
Program except as described under the terms of this License.  Any
attempt to do anything with or to the Program that is counter to
the word or intent of this License is void, and will automatically
terminate all your rights under this License, you jerk.  However,
any party who has received copies or rights from you under the terms
of this License shall not have his, her or its licenses terminated
so long as he, she or it remains a good little licensee and follows
the conditions and terms of this License.

  5. There is no obligation for you to accept this License, as you
have not signed it.  However, you have no rights under the Law,
outside of this License, to copy, modify, or distribute the Program
or create works based on the Program.  By doing any of the above
actions, you are implicitly agreeing to accept all the terms and
conditions of this License for all actions it covers.

  6. Every recipient of the Program or any work based on the Program
automatically receives a license from the original licensor to do
any of the actions covered in this License under the terms and
conditions of this License.  You may not impose on any recipient any
further terms or conditions or restrict any recipient's exercise
of their rights as granted herein.  You have no responsibility for
enforcing the compliance of others to the terms and conditions of
this License.  You are not your licensee's keeper.

  7. If any reason whatsoever causes you to be unable or unwilling
to abide by the exact and complete terms and conditions of this
License, be it court judgments on (but not limited to) patent
and/or copyright issues; financial, physical, mental, and/or any
other disability; and/or any form of personal disagreement with
the letter and/or intent of this License and/or with any and/or
all licensors and/or licensees; then you may not distribute the
Program at all as long as said reason and/or reasons still
apply, or other similar reasons surface.  For example: if you
are under the influence of mind-control that compels you to
alter the Program such that it serves to subvert any
anti-mind-control properties of the Program and/or help the
evil forces of mind-control in their bid to destroy the
freewill of Humanity and subjugate Humanity to mental slavery
as per Subsection 2d hereinbefore, then the only way you could
satisfy this License would be to not distribute the Program or
the work based on the Program at all.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under any particular circumstance, then all the rest will still
apply and the section as a whole will apply in any and all other
circumstances.

This section doesn't intend for you to do any bad things; it
only desires that you do good and/or legal things.  The purpose
of this section is to protect the integrity of the free
anti-mind-control distribution system by making sure that only
those willing and/or able to abide by this License in its
entirety, at all times, attempt to exercise any or all rights
granted herein.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted
in certain political bodies by copyright or patent concerns, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may explicitly exclude distribution in those geographical or
political bodies, such that distribution is limited to only those
geopolitical bodies not thus excluded.  If this is so, said
distribution limitations shall be considered as if included in the
body of this License.  Restrictions on distribution and/or use of
the Program for purely political reasons (such as, but not limited
to, governmental interest in mind-control hegemony) shall not--for
the greater good of Humanity--be considered as reason for
geopolitical distribution limitations.  Fight the Power!

  9. Zapato Productions Intradimensional, or its founder and sole
employee Lyle Zapato, may publish revised and/or new versions of the
MindGuard Public License at any time.  Such new versions will be
similar to the present version in general intent, but may differ in
details.

Each version is to be given an unique version number.  The following
terms explain which version is applicable for the Program:

    a) If the Program specifies a specific version, then the Program
    is licensed only under that version of the License.

    b) If the Program also specifies that it is licensed under "any
    later version", then you have the option of following the terms
    and conditions of the stated version or any later version
    published as per Section 9, Paragraph 1 herein.

    c) If the Program does not specify a version, then you may follow
    the terms of any version of the License ever published as per
    Section 9, Paragraph 1 herein.

    d) If the Program specifies that it is licensed under the "most
    recent version", then only the terms and conditions of the most
    recent version of the License applies and the terms and conditions
    of all previous versions shall be considered void.  Voidification
    of previous terms and conditions only applies for actions after
    the release date of the most recent version of the License and
    shall not be retroactive, however it shall extend to all spawned
    licensees as per Sections 2, 6, and others hereinbefore.

If the Program gives an option, as per Subsections 9b and 9c
hereinbefore, as to which version of the License may apply, that
option must also be extended to all licensees of copies of the Program
or works based on the program.

  10. You may not incorporate the Program or parts of the Program into
other works whose distribution and licensing conditions differ from
this License unless the author of the other work gives you explicit
permission to, which must include unconditionally agreeing to the
conditions of this License; or the resulting work is for personal,
private, non-distributed use only.  For software which is copyrighted
by Zapato Productions Intradimensional or Lyle Zapato, write to me; I
will make exceptions if I feel they are in the best interests of
Humanity's struggle against the Evil Forces of Mind-Control.


		ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, WHATSOEVER
			(NOT EVEN A LITTLE)

  11. THIS PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE SO THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR IT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  YOU GET WHAT YOU
PAY FOR.  UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
"AS IS" BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR ANY OTHER PARTIES INVOLVED
WITHOUT ANY SORT OF WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, FOR ALL ETERNITY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS, ACTUAL OR
PERCEIVED, FOR ANY PURPOSE, PARTICULAR OR GENERAL, OR FOR PURPOSE
RELATED PURPOSES (HEREAFTER TO BE CALLED "METAPURPOSES").  YOU ASSUME
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, AND FASHIONABLE APPEAL
OF THE PROGRAM.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM BE EVIDENTLY DEFECTIVE: TOO DARN
BAD.  YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY AND ALL COSTS INVOLVED IN SERVICING,
REPAIR, CORRECTION, AND/OR REPLACEMENT.  SUCK IT UP, LOSER.

  12. IN NO EVENT WHATSOEVER (UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
AGREED TO IN WRITING) WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
PERMITTED TO DISTRIBUTE AND/OR MODIFY THE PROGRAM AS SPECIFIED ABOVE,
BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, MEDIOCRE, INCIDENTAL, DENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE, MISUSE, FAILURE TO USE, OR INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF
DATA, MENTAL RETARDATION, BRAIN VIRUSES, BROKEN MARRIAGES,
SPONTANEOUS HARDDRIVE COMBUSTION, AND/OR LYME DISEASE), EVEN IF SUCH
HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY WAS FULLY AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES AND LAUGHED MANIACALLY WHEN THEY OCCURRED.

		YAY! END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


	Appendix: Lets Apply These Terms to Your New Program!

  If you developed new anti-mind-control software and you want it
to be of the greatest possible use to Humanity in its struggle
against the Forces of Evil, the best way to achieve this is to make
it free software that everyone can redistribute, but only non-evil
people can modify, under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program, preferably
to the start of each source file, making sure that the NO WARRANTY
notice is annoyingly prominent.  At the very least, the copyright
notice and a pointer to the full notice should be included.

    &#60;program's name and brief description.&#62;
    Copyright (C) 20yy  &#60;name of author&#62; 

    This program is free anti-mind-control software; you can
    redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the
    MindGuard Public License as published by Zapato Productions
    Intradimensional, or its founder Lyle Zapato; the most recent
    version of the License applies.

    This software is provided AS IS with NO WARRANTY of ANY SORT
    WHATSOEVER as to its MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS, actual or
    PERCEIVED, for any PURPOSE, PARTICULAR OR GENERAL, or for
    PURPOSE RELATED PURPOSES (hereafter referred to as
    METAPURPOSES); nor can this VEHEMENT DENIAL of WARRANTY in
    any way BE CONSTRUED or TAKEN TO IMPLY evidence of a SECRET
    WARRANTY, the EXISTENCE of which is being COVERED UP for
    NEFARIOUS PURPOSES or METAPURPOSES.  See the MindGuard
    Public License for details

    If you did not receive a copy of the MindGuard Public
    License along with this program, you may find a copy at:

      http://zapatopi.net/mgpl.html

Also add information on how to contact you.  You may, however,
skip this if you do not want agents of the New World Order
tracking you down and "silencing" you.  But you should at least
have an email address.

If the program is interactive, make it display a short notice
when it starts or wherever such information normally would be
displayed.  Example for a text based program:

    BrainScan version -273.16, Copyright (C) 20yy &#60;name of author&#62;
    BrainScan comes with NO FREAKING WARRANTY AT ALL!; for details
    type "I don't understand the meaning of NO WARRANTY".
    This is free anti-mind-control software, and you may
    redistribute it under certain conditions; type "show me the
    conditions, please" for those conditions.

The commands would display the appropriate information.  You should
customize this for what ever best suits your program, for instance
using buttons instead of typed commands if it is GUI based.

You should also get your school or employer to sign a "copyright
disclaimer" for the program to ensure that they don't claim it as
theirs by virtue of owning your brain and/or any products thereof.
Example follows (change to suit):


  Evil Mind-Control Agency, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
  interest in the program 'BrainScan' (which scans brains for
  implanted memories) written by Paul P. Programmer.

  &#60;signature of Dr. Ernesto&#62;, 26 June 2001
  Dr. Ernesto, President of Evil

This Public License does not permit incorporation of covered
programs into proprietary programs.  If you wish to allow linking
of your program with proprietary applications as a subroutine
library, don't use this License.  Find another one.
