<P>MindGuard was created with care to ensure that your mind will be safe from psychotronic intrusions. However, technology doesn't stand still. New carriers and more insidious ways of using them are being devised every week. Eventually, MindGuard will come upon a signal that it can't jam or even scramble. That is why it is important to always get the most current version of MindGuard.</P>

<H4>What To Do In Case Of A Failure:</H4>
<UL>
<LI><P><B>DON'T PANIC!</B> Panic actually heightens the effects of psychotronic signals. To relieve panic induced stress I suggest you try breathing exercises or imagining yourself suspended in a pool of soothing lime Jello.</P>

<LI><P>Find a well-shielded area (deep basement, fallout shelter, inside of a refrigerator, etc.) and move your computer and yourself there if you already haven't. This will be your base of operations.</P>

<LI><P>Avoid all contact with other people, they may be acting as psychotronic relay vectors.<P>

<LI><P>Make an <A href="http://zapatopi.net/afdb/">Aluminum Foil Deflector Beanie</A> and <B>USE IT!</B></P>

<LI><P>Check where you got MindGuard to see if any new carrier modules have been released. If so, get and <A href="carriers.html">install them</A>.</P>
