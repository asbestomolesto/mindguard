<P>If you think protecting your hard drive from viruses is important, but give no thought to the safety of your mind, please consider the following:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The technology to implant ideas and images into a person's mind using electromagnetic and sonic waves was invented more than sixty years ago and has been growing more sophisticated yearly.

<LI>Secret agencies are conspiring to control your life and force you to live under a One World Government.  The only thing stopping them are people of differing opinions.

<LI>Alien forces are seeking to subjugate humanity to their dominion. Abductees commonly report having their memories/minds altered.

<LI>Governmental regulations of questionable origin are forcing us to rid our world of <A href="lead.html">lead</A> based products and the benefits they hold.

<LI>The big buzzword in policing is "Nonlethal Weaponry", devices that don't hurt people but make them "surrender" unconditionally and uncontrollably.

<LI>The rise in "Entertainment Attractions" in places such as Las Vegas and Florida (not to mention the continued growth of the granddad of them all: <A href="tikiroom.html">Disneyland</A>) is creating concentration points where the populations of the world are herded together and subjected to intense psychological programming.

<LI>David Hasselhof continues to impress German TV viewers.

<LI>The seemingly innocent babble of the Teletubbies is designed to appeal to very young children on an almost biological level inculcating in them the desire to live in a world where faceless voices command obedience under the ever-watchful gaze of Big Baby. Tinky Winky may be purple, but Po is most certainly Red.

<LI>Sony (a megamultinational with a special interest in "intellectual property") has created a robotic dog--named Aibo--that it hopes will become humanity's new best friend. The dog communicates with its owners through hypnotic limb gyrations and high-pitched sonic blips that could easily contain subliminal programming. A Japanese dictionary at hand lists "aiboo" as meaning "accomplice".

<P>Clearly, people's minds are in greater danger now than they have ever been in the history of our planet.</P>

<P>That's why you need MindGuard.</P>

<P>MindGuard is a program that protects your mind by jamming and/or scrambling psychotronic mind-control signals and removing harmful engrammic pollutants from your brain. It also has the ability to scan for and decipher into English specific signals so you can see exactly <B>Who</B> wants to control you and what <B>They</B> are trying to make you think.</P>

<P>With MindGuard, you can rest assured that your most valuable possession--<B>your mind</B>--is safe from the nefarious tinkering of evil-doers.</P>

<P>Remember: <B>MIND YOUR MIND!</B></P>
