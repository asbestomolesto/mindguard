<H4>When To Use:</H4>
<DIV class="margin">
<P>In a word: <I>ALWAYS</I>. In fact, if you haven't run MindGuard yet, do so <I>IMMEDIATELY</I>!  Every second that you don't have it running, you are exposing yourself to potential <I>MIND PROGRAMMING</I>.</P>
</DIV>

<A name="multiuser"></A>
<H4>Multiuserability</H4>
<DIV class="margin">
<P>MindGuard X has been designed with a multiuser system in mind. Not only does it keep <A href="prefs.html">seperate preferences</A> for each user in his or her home directory, but MindGuard X can also be run by multiple simultaneous users over a network. By taking advantage of the network cabling and/or wireless transmitter (and the horrible security holes in the X Windows system), MindGuard can open up anti-psychotronic conduits on the user's terminal even if he or she isn't physically near the computer on which MindGuard is actually running.</P>
