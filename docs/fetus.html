<P>Perhaps those most susceptible to psychotronic programing are fetuses. As a fetus's brain is still developing, any engramic signals that may come in contact with it could leave permanent damage that will affect the child's future mental development. This fact hasn't gone unnoticed by those that wish to control people through psychotronics. Some agencies are actually targeting the unborn in order to control the way the future generation thinks!</P>

<P>MindGuard does offer protection to fetuses. All jamming algorithms have been designed with pre-borns in mind.</P>

<P>However, pregnant women should use a modified <A href="http://zapatopi.net/afdb/">AFDB</A>
over their womb to provide extra protection.</P>
