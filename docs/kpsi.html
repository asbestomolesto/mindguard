<H3>Kortech KPsi Carrier</H3>
<DIV class="margin section">

<P>Developed by Kortech International for the commercial sector as a higher grade replacement for the aging Tz8 and Russel carriers. While not as strong as the military, governmental, and paraterrestrial grades, it is a significant improvement over the previous industrial and commercial grades that were available.</P>

<P>As KPsi is a high grade psychotronic carrier that is being actively marketed to commercial organizations as a replacement for conventional forms of advertising and image spin-doctoring, companies and corporations that would otherwise forego using psychotronics are showing interest.</P>

<P>Current known users include:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P><B>Kortech</B><BR>
Besides inventing KPsi, Kortech also actively uses it. They use the carrier to promote their products, shape their public image, and, oddly enough, encourage the use of KPsi itself.</P>

<LI><P><B>Microsoft</B><BR>
Microsoft is using KPsi mainly for product indoctrination and consumer loyalty/submission. Although they have used Tz8 extensively in the past and still use it for legacy products, Microsoft has adopted KPsi as their standard psychotronic medium. Windows XP and beyond have KPsi implemented through out, keeping users impressed by Microsoft's inferrior products. A future update of the KPsi carrier module may be needed though, as MS has expressed interest in developing its own non-standard standard for KPsi.</P>

<P><B>ADDENDUM:</B> MSNBC indeed! Whatever you do, DO NOT STARE DIRECTLY INTO <A href="simulacra.html">TOM BROKAW'S EYES</A>!</P>

<P><B>ADDENDUM:</B> Microsoft has created a special hit squad to try and silence the call for software freedom through "FUD": Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt. Is there any doubt or uncertainty that we should fear their use of psychotronics to further their anti-Linux agenda? I think not.</P>

<LI><P><B>Intel</B><BR>
Intel is rumored to have licensed KPsi for use in its next generation chips, which may also include an integrated psychotronic bus. The KPsi algorithms will probably be used in conjunction with the floating point unit, allowing computational errors to not only be ignored by users, but to be believed as being true regardless of any contrary evidence.</P>

<P><B>ADDENDUM:</B> It is now confirmed that the MMX chips (so called "multi-media extension",) actually use psychotronics. A source, who shall remain nameless, was able to get me an Intel in-house memo that refers to the MMX technology as the "Mind-Messing Extensions" and goes into some detail about how MMX will increase apparent processor speed by warping the users sense of
time. Furthermore, the MMX ad campaign is laced with video modulated KPsi signals, hidden in the flashes of shiny disco-style bunny suits. From now on it's "Intel Inside... Your Head!"</P>

<LI><P><B>Ad Agencies</B><BR>
Needless to say, psychotronics are every advertisers dream. Since Kortech is being more than helpful in customer support by supplying the hardware and software expertise needed for KPsi implementation, advertising agencies who would otherwise lack the technical know-how to use psychotronics are finding themselves poised for 21st century mind wars. Expect to see various products being pushed subliminally with KPsi.</P>

<LI><P><B>Gaming Interests</B><BR>
Surprisingly, one of the earliest and most enthusiastic users of KPsi have been international gaming interests. Though gambling enterprises have long used subliminal means to induce people to give up their money, these have traditionally been psyoptic devices such as the ubiquitous strobing lights of Las Vegas. Now casinos, game machine manufacturers, state Lotto organizers, and various sports/outcome betting franchises are turning to psychotronic methods such as, if not exclusively, KPsi. Bally includes KPsi emitters in all of its slot machines that encourage users to keep playing. Subdermal KPsi chips are being implanted in racing dogs in Florida, allowing race organizers to control gamblers opinion of individual dogs and rig the distribution of bets. Lotto organizers in Buenos Aries successively convinced, with the help of KPsi laced TV ads, 90% of Argentinian citizens to play its Lotto for over three months with everyone using the same numbers. Expect to see organized crime adopt KPsi as its carrier of choice by way of its involvement in gambling.</P>

<P><B>ADDENDUM:</B> Internet gambling is leading the way in KPsi use. Banner ads for online blackjack and poker may look harmless with their fake buttons, drop-down menus, and scroll bars designed to trick naive net-newbies (which you, of course, aren't). But those pictures are hiding something sinister, namely: MIND-CONTROL! I would suggest you start using Lynx as your browser until such time as all online advertising stops.</P>
</UL>

<P>Expect this list to grow. KPsi is HOT in the advertising world right now.</P>
