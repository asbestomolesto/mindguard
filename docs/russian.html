<H3>Russian Carrier</H3>
<DIV class="margin section">

<P>The Soviets pioneered the development of psychotronic devises in the late Twenties, and their Tz class was the first, fully functional, terrestrial psychotronic delivery system.</P>

<P>Tz specs 1 through 7 are functionally obsolete due to their reliance on VHF and UHF, although some cable companies incorporate them into their signals to get consumers to buy pay-per-view sports events. Tz8, however, uses EHF and, while it lacks the bells and whistles of the more cutting-edge carriers, is still relevant.</P>

<P>In the "post-Cold War" era, Soviet Tz8 equipment can be had on the cheap where ever arms are sold, so it is used by anyone who can't afford the more expensive <A href="cia.html">CIA Russel</A> equipment.  This includes Third World countries, large corporations, ambitious organizations, and power-hungry individuals.</P>

<P>Some more notable Tz8 users include:  Republican and Democratic parties, Microsoft, the Consortium of Cable Companies (CCC), the Aum Shinrikio cult, the NeoAmish, and the Scientologists.</P>

<P>Although the SVRR still uses Tz8 for lesser tasks, they now mainly use Russel.</P>
