<P>The Liberati Overlords, the elite terrestrial ruling class of the Xeno-Socialist New World Order, use their own distinct carrier that works in the VLF and ELF range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Liberati carrier uses the most complex enciphering method of the terrestrial carriers, acting on the brainstem and causing its signal to reach the higher reasoning center through indirect means.</P>

<P>The Liberati carrier is used only by the Liberati. It is most often used to breed sycophantic allegiance among the various other terrestrial mind control agencies over whom the Liberati hold dominion, but it is also used for control of the masses and general paraterrestrial bashing.</P>
