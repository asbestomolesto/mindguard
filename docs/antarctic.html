<H3>Antarctic Relay Carrier</H3>
<DIV class="margin section">

<P>This carrier is used exclusively by a paraterrestrial agency that has established bases of operations in Antarctica. Antarctic Relay uses ELF and MLF to deliver their signals over huge distances from Antarctica by piggy-backing on signals from human communication satellites.</P>

<P>It is not known who controls the agency but it is known to be run by hyperactive, quasi-mammalian lifeforms known as Ferretoids. Little is known about the Ferretoids, and it is not certain that they are acting of their own accord.</P>
