<P>The CIA created and uses the following carriers:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P>CIA Russel and variants - This is the workhorse of CIA Psyops. It uses the EHF radiometric spectrum for delivery and acts directly on the cerebral cortex. Russel and it's variants are used by many agencies the world over; it is a sort of "generic" carrier. In fact, governments other than the US now use this more than the CIA or other other US agencies. This is mainly due to the easy availability of Russel transmitters in the intelligence community and their superiority over the Russian alternative.</P>

<LI><P>CIA-Beta - This is a more advanced carrier that was introduced about a decade ago. It also uses EHF, but it's interaction on the brain is many times more complex than Russel. CIA-Beta is only known to be used by the CIA, its subsidiaries, and the NSA (who developed it.)</P>
