presented by Dole Pineapple</DIV>

<P>Opened at Disneyland in 1962, the Enchanted Tiki Room was the first attraction to make extensive use of audioanimatronics. It features colorful robot birds that sing and tell corney jokes for the amusement of park goers. Created by Disney Imagineers who had never visited Polynesia, the Enchanted Tiki Room's Pacific ambiance is a testament to Disney's philosophy of "Alternative History". After enjoying a cup of sweet Dole pineapple juice while waiting in the outdoor foyer, enter the Enchanted Tiki Room, take a seat, and immerse yourself in the sounds
of clacking plastic and muffled, 30 year old monophonic recordings. But take care, least the Gods become angry at all the celebrating!</P>

<P>Despite the evilness of this attraction (or is it because of it?) it has survived, tucked away in an unused corner of Adventureland. It has seen more famous attractions such as the Skyway, People-Mover, the Submarine Voyage, and the Journey Through Inner-Space come and go. What could account for the Enchanted Tiki Room's longevity? Is it really a psychosonic programming center where Disneyland guests are converted into bioanimatronic stooges for the New World Order? Is it a front operation for the Walt Disney's cryogenic tomb?  Or is it simply the ATTRACTION THAT TIME FORGOT?</P>
