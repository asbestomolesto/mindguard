<H3>Truth About Lead</H3>

<P>This is an article that I posted a while ago, since it is relevant here, I am including it.</P>

<H4 align="center">"What They Don't Want You To Know About Lead"</H4>

<P>Fact: lead is a natural radiation blocker.</P>

<P>In our modern world filled with electromagnetic radiation from TVs, computers, powerlines, cellular phones, and the myriad of other electronic devices we wouldn't dare live without, we need all the radiation protection we can get. But, for years now, Liberal Environmentalists have been trying to rid our world of lead. They insist that it is bad for us; this couldn't be farther from the truth. Lead is actually a needed part of the modern environment. Instead of trying to limit the amount of lead we should be encouraging people to increase it.</P>

<P>Steps need to be taken to accomplish this. Current Liberal regulations regarding lead should be voided and replaced with incentives for businesses to increase production of lead-based products. Lead waste should be de-classified as hazardous and instead be allowed to be dumped in public landfills. Attempts to rid lakes and rivers of lead should be stopped; lead saturated fish provide an important means of introducing lead into the food chain. Cars should be required to burn only lead-based fuel. This will increase atmospheric content of lead particles, which acts as a buffer between people and electromagnetic radiation sources such as transformers. Furthermore, children, who are most susceptible to the effects of radiation since their bodies are still growing, can be protected by supplementing their diet with flakes of old paint.</P>

<P>Why have the Liberals been so determined to limit environmental lead content? It's not out of ignorance of lead's radioactive shielding properties. On the contrary, environmental groups have long known that people with lead-enriched blood have a lower rate of various cancers usually attributed with radiation exposure. So, what are their motives?</P>
