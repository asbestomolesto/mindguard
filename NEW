MINDGUARD NEW:
------------------------------------------------------------
2020-14-04 - v0.0.0.5 - codename "Tank Petus Ufo"
gtk 2.0 patches and fixes by Zeld @ freaknet 

After extensive tests conducted in our special EMP protected
bunker at Freaknet Medialab, we're happy to release a new
version of Mindguard. We fixed compiling errors due to 
the new GTK libs, and other problems.

We tried to contact Lyle Zapato for a long time. We think his
ultradimensional communication system is jammed by an unknown
carrier, so we gave up. In hope to create a diversion in the
continuum, we hereby decided to release this new version of the
software. 

 * GTK now compiles
 * strings manipulation error fixed
 * static binary included

For any inquiry or request, please contact us on shortwave
radio frequency 6925 KHz USB from 0700 to 0715 GMT.

should).
