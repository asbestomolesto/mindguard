This version came from https://github.com/asbestomolesto/mindguard

INSTALLATION:

  It's what you would expect:

>$ apt install libgtk-2.0-dev (they're needed!)

>$ cd [directory where source is]
>$ make
>$ su
># make install

  Installation copies the MindGuard binary to /usr/local/bin
and makes the dir /usr/local/share/MindGuard and copies the
carriers dir (with modules) and the html documentation
there.  You can try MindGuard out before you install it by
typing "./mindguard" since it will recognize the carriers
dir at ./carriers and load the modules from there.

  To install without the ~120k of html docs, use this
instead:

># make install-nodocs

  If you would rather install everything in your home dir,
use this as yourself (not root):

>$ make install-home

  To put just the carrier modules and the html docs in your
home dir, use:

>$ make install-home-dataonly

  Afterwards, to install just the program, use this as
root:

># make install-bin

  Or finally, if you are Mr. Leet CLI Guy, just copy
everything manually. The only consideration is the carrier
dir which must be either in ~/MindGuard/,
/usr/local/share/MindGuard/, or your current directory
in order for MindGuard to run. However, you can work around
this by using the -carrier_path command line command when
running MindGuard to specify an alternate carrier dir.
